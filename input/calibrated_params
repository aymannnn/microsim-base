# The format for this file is very specific, so pay attention closely.
# Spelling and capitalization really matters ... especially for the
# type of the parameter.
# The first thing to type is the parameter name exactaly how you will 
# be calling it in the model code: for example, "COUCH_TO_5K".
# Then, type the type of the parameter as either: CONSTANT, LINEAR, or
# LOGISTIC.
# Then, you must type the current value, lower bound, and upper bound of
# EACH DISTINCT DEFINING VALUE OF THE CALIBRATED VALUE.
# A constant has only one, since it's constant; a linear has two, which is
# the intercept and slope; a logistic has three, which is
# horizontal asymtote, shift, and steepness.
# The ORDER OF DEFINING VALUES MATTERS, and it's the same as described
# above.
# The program will terminate (with a nice error) if anything is missing.
# Note that everything must be comma separated. An example parameter is below.
# Add as many parameters as you'd like. Comments (#), newlines, and
# whitespace are ignored.
